# Lane-Keeping-Assist-with-OpenCV-Python-Fuzzy-Logic-and-CARLA-3D-Simulator
This repository contains a Python implementation of a lane-keeping assist system using computer vision, fuzzy logic, and integration with the CARLA 3D simulator. It helps develop and test autonomous driving algorithms by simulating a realistic driving environment and providing lane-keeping functionality.
